# Stealth

SQL query builder for multiple databases. Heavily inspired by Kotlin's [Ktorm](https://www.ktorm.org).

Not at all ready for real use. (There's not even any tests, so don't be crazy and try to use it for real.)

   ```yaml
   dependencies:

       github: matthewmcgarvey/stealth
   ```

2. Run `shards install`
